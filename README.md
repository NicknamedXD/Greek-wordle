# Greek Wordle Game

## Overview

This Python script implements a Greek Wordle game, allowing players to guess a Greek word within a limited number of attempts. The game offers two difficulty levels: normal and hard.

## Features

- **Difficulty Levels:**
  - **Normal Mode:** Standard word-guessing game.
  - **Hard Mode:** Introduces additional challenges, such as restricting the use of letters not present in the word.

- **Greek Language Support:** Focuses on Greek words for an immersive language learning experience.
- **Word Selection:** Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- **Feedback System:** Provides feedback on the correctness of the guessed word, taking into account multiple instances of letters.
- **User Input Validation:** Ensures user input is a valid 5-letter Greek word.

## How to Play

1. **Select Difficulty:** Run the script and choose between normal and hard mode.
2. **Guess the Word:** Enter a 5-letter Greek word as your guess.
3. **Feedback:** Receive feedback on your guess, with 'O' indicating correct letters in the correct position and 'X' for correct letters in the wrong position.
